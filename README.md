[![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@astronautlabs/conduit.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@astronautlabs/conduit) [![Build Status](https://circleci.com/gh/astronautlabs/conduit/tree/main.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/astronautlabs/conduit)

A powerful way to do RPC on the web.

```ts
import * as conduit from '@astronautlabs/conduit';

let [channelA, channelB] = conduit.LocalChannel.makePair();

@conduit.Name('com.example.randomNumber')
class MyService {
    @conduit.Method()
    getRandomNumber() {
        return Math.random();
    }
}

let sessionA = new conduit.RPCSession(channelA);
sessionA.registerService(MyService);

// ---

let sessionB = new conduit.RPCSession(channelB);
let remoteObject = await session.getRemoteService(MyService);

let number = await remoteObject.getRandomNumber();
console.log(number);
```

# Object References

You aren't limited to singleton services with `@/conduit`

```typescript
import * as conduit from '@astronautlabs/conduit';

let [channelA, channelB] = conduit.LocalChannel.makePair();

@conduit.Name('com.example.randomNumber')
class MyService {
    @conduit.Method()
    getRandomGenerator(min: number, max: number) {
        return new RandomGenerator(min, max);
    }
}

@conduit.Remotable()
class RandomGenerator {
    constructor(readonly min: number, max: number) {
    }

    @conduit.Method()
    random() {
        return min + Math.random() * (max - min) | 0;
    }
}

let sessionA = new conduit.RPCSession(channelA);
sessionA.registerService(MyService);

// ---

let sessionB = new conduit.RPCSession(channelB);
let remoteObject = await session.getRemoteService(MyService);

let generator = await remoteObject.getRandomGenerator(4, 8);
console.log(await generator.random()); // 6
console.log(await generator.random()); // 4
console.log(await generator.random()); // 7
console.log(await generator.random()); // 5
```

# Events

```typescript
import * as conduit from '@astronautlabs/conduit';

let [channelA, channelB] = conduit.LocalChannel.makePair();

@conduit.Name('com.example.randomNumber')
class MyService {
    constructor() {
        setTimeout(() => this._timer.next(), 1000);
    }

    private _timer: Subject<void>;
    private _timerObservable: Observable<void>;

    @Event()
    get timer() { return this._timerObservable; }
}

let sessionA = new RPCSession(channelA);
sessionA.registerService(MyService);

// ---

let sessionB = new conduit.RPCSession(channelB);
let remoteObject = await session.getRemoteService(MyService);

let subscription = await remoteObject.timer.subscribe(() => console.log(`tick`));
setTimeout(async () => await subscription.unsubscribe(), 5*1000);

// console: tick
// console: tick
// console: tick
// console: tick
// console: tick
```

# Wire Format

`@/conduit` encodes messages in JSON, making it ideal for use on the web. Each message has a type, identified by the 
`type` field. There are four types of message:

- `request` -- Request a specific method to be called on a given object, with the given function parameters.
- `response` -- Indicate that a method call has completed
- `ping` -- Check if the connection is still working
- `pong` -- Respond that the connection is indeed still working.

See below for details about these message types.

## `request`
```json
{
    "type": "request",
    "id": "da860252-ce2b-4182-9e8d-3bda07e9f228",
    "receiver": { /* object reference, see below */ },
    "method": "methodName",
    "parameters": [123, "abcdef"],
    "metadata": { /* arbitrary data */ }
}
```

This type of method is sent whenever a remote procedure call is initiated.

- `id` -- A UUIDv4 which is unique to this request. It will be used to identify the response which correlates with this request.
- `receiver` -- The remote object which should receive this message. This will be a Reference, see below for more details on how references work.
- `method` -- The string name of the method which is being called. If the method is not allowed, an error will be returned in the response.
- `parameters` -- An array of the positional parameters that should be passed to the method. Any valid JSON object is allowed, and References are also supported (see below).
- `metadata` -- Arbitary data that Conduit itself will not consider. Useful for passing useful information from the sender to the receiver.

## `response`
```json
{
    "type": "response",
    "id": "da860252-ce2b-4182-9e8d-3bda07e9f228",
    "error": null,
    "value": "return value from the method"
}
```

A successful response will have `error` be null/undefined. A failure response will have `error` be anything other than 
null or undefined. 
- Upon receiving a successful response, Conduit will resolve the promise corresponding to the method call with the 
  given `value`. 
- Upon receiving a failure response, Conduit will reject the promise correspondsing to the method call with the given 
  `error`.

## `ping`
```json
{ "type": "ping" }
```

Can be sent to ensure that message passing is still working over the given channel. Not sent by Conduit by default, see 
the included `DurableSocket` and `DurableSocketChannel` types for more information. When a Conduit session receives 
this message, it always responds with a corresponding `pong` message (see below).

## `pong`
```json
{ "type": "pong" }
```

## References

Conduit supports the ability to refer to remote objects (and local remotable objects) within the request/response 
messages that make up RPC calls.

In fact, this capability is fundamental to how the mechanism works. Every RPC call specifies what object a method is 
being called on as the `receiver` object. The receiver is specified using a Reference.

```json
{ 
    "RÎµ": "3f7204da-3ace-4edc-8bf3-0c841970c117",
    "S": "L", 
    "Rid": "7a4ba201-fac1-4fda-b26b-270518549e6f" 
}
```

- `RÎµ`: The ID of the object
- `S`: The "side" that owns this object from the perspective of the sender of the reference object (`L` for "local to 
  sender", `R` for "remote to sender"). Since both sides have local and remote sides and these references are 
  interchanged, the context of where the reference was sent from is important for determining it's meaning. For 
  instance if a message is received which indicates "local side", then this means it is "local to the sender" and 
  "remote to the receiver". If a message is *sent* which indicates remote side, then this means it is "remote to the 
  sender" and "local to the receiver".
- `Rid`: The ID of the reference itself. This is used for properly implementing remote garbage collection (see below).
  Some well-known references do not support multi-referencing, in those cases this field will be omitted or empty (see 
  below).

## Garbage Collection

References to remote objects intelligently handle garbage collection. References on the remote side keep the objects 
they refer to on the local side alive (they won't be garbage collected). When remote references are discarded and get 
garbage collected, references on the server side are automatically discarded to allow objects to be garbage collected.

Every object reference sent within a Conduit message represents a unique reference to a specific object. While each of 
those unique references are outstanding, the sender must not allow the referenced objects to be garbage collected. Each 
one of those references must be finalized by the receiver before the referenced object may be collected. 

Since Conduit only keeps one proxy per remote object, most of the references created to a given object will be 
immediately dismissed. As soon as Conduit resolves the references to an already existing proxy object, it will no 
longer need the new reference. However if no proxy exists yet, the reference will *not* be finalized.

## Well-Known References

If you've read all the above and you now understand that _every_ `request` must specify a valid object reference, you 
might be wondering how an initial `request` would be possible since there are no other calls which might be used to 
tell you how to populate the `receiver` references. You might also wonder how references are finalized for the purposes 
of garbage collection.

All of the base machinery that enables this functionality is provided by the `RPCSession` class itself, _which is 
itself a remotable Conduit object_. There is always exactly 1 `RPCSession` object on each end of an RPC session (makes 
sense), and it is referred to with a special kind of reference called a "well known reference".

Well known references are those where instead of a UUID, the object being referred to has a well-known ID which can be 
predicted by the other side of the conversation. The ID of the `RPCSession` object is always `org.webrpc.session`, so 
it is always possible to refer to this object even before any messages have been sent. Furthermore, the `RPCSession`'s 
lifespan is always at least as long as the lifetime of the channel which it services, which means there is no need to 
manage references for it. Because of these factors, we can create the following reference for the remote's RPCSession 
instance without knowing anything about the object iself, the channel, etc.

```json
{ "RÎµ": "org.webrpc.session", "S": "R" }
```

APIs like service discovery, introspection, and reference finalization are all implemented as Conduit RPC calls to the 
remote side's `RPCSession` instance. For more about those APIs read on below.

# Channels

You can use any kind of communication channel underneath an RPCSession. Some channel types are included:

* `SocketChannel` - Perform RPC over a WebSocket
* `WindowChannel` - Perform RPC between the current window and a remote window, such as an `<iframe>` or a popup
* `LocalChannel` - A simple two-sided in-memory channel that is good for testing.

Since RPC over WebSockets is so common, it is made especially convenient:

```typescript
let session = await RPCSession.connect(`wss://example.com/my/socket`);
```

When the promise returned by `connect()` resolves the connection is fully established and ready for communication. If a 
connection error occurs, the promise will reject.

---

You can implement your own custom channels by implementing the `RPCChannel` interface

```typescript
export interface RPCChannel {
    received: Observable<string>;
    send(message: string);
    close?();
}
```

# Services

The primary purpose of Conduit is to expose service objects with well-known identities which have well-known interfaces.
From a developer experience perspective, you need only use `registerService` and `getRemoteService()` to register 
service classes of your own and consume methods of the remote service you are talking to. Remember that Conduit is 
bidirectional, and services can be registered on either side. It is totally possible (and sometimes desirable) for a 
WebSocket *client* to register a named service, and for the WebSocket *server* to acquire an instance of that service 
and call RPC methods on it.

For those interested in the mechanics of how this works, the local `RPCSession` implements 
`async getRemoteService(serviceName)` as `await this.remote.getLocalService(serviceName)`, where `this.remote` is the 
RPC proxy of the remote `RPCSession`. So there is no special mechanics for service discovery, these are just well known 
RPC calls of the `RPCSession` class.

# Service Factories

While it is possible for the pair of `RPCSession` instances to communicate over a Conduit channel without any 
coordination because they use long-lived well-known object references, the potential ways you might want to manage 
the object lifecycles related to actual "service" objects within the applications you build with Conduit may differ
greatly depending on your use case. By default service objects are created on-demand for a specific RPCSession 
and are not shared, but you might want to share service objects across multiple sessions (ie multiple connections in the
context of Conduit over Websockets). Control of the lifecycle of service objects can be controlled using custom 
"service factories".

```typescript
session.registerService(MyService, () => myServiceInstance); // where myServiceInstance is not specific to this session
```

Service factories are passed a single argument, the `RPCSession` that is responsible for creating them. This allows you 
easy access to the related session if you need it.

```typescript
session.registerService(MyService, session => new MyService(session));
```

Since service factories are just functions, you could use this to add dependency injection.

# Services without registration, and other low-level customization

If you wish to dynamically create services with arbitrary logic, you can subclass `RPCSession`. 

```typescript
class MySession extends RPCSession {
    @Method()
    override getLocalService(identity: string) {
        // Add arbitrary logic for creating service objects here
        return new MyService();
    }
}
```

This can be used to modify any part of the base APIs, or even add new top-level APIs. It is also how one might use 
well-known references within an application, since the default implementation of `RPCSession` does not provide any 
mechanism for using well-known references (other than the `RPCSession` well known reference).
